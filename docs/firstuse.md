# First use

## "Installation"
The NotedW is a SPA, which means that just a single HTML file is needed. Copy the file to a sympathetic folder or onto your desktop et voil√°, the NotedW is installed on your computer.

To fire up, just open a browser. Theoretically it works in all major browsers - but only Chrome is tested. Open the file in your browser, and you will find an empty notebook, like this:

![Empty notebook](res/NotedW_empty.png?raw=true)

## Get some demo data
It may be a little cumbersome to start with a blank page. Some demo data is available [here](res/notedw_demo_data.txt). Save it to a local folder, then click on the cogwheel icon in the top right corner, choose "Load local file" under the Restore section. Browse for the saved file to load the demo data.

Navigate around by clicking the function buttons on the top, or by clicking on the existing/non-existing pages. Try the different functions freely - you can always return to the clean demo by restoring/loading it again. Or if you are ready to move on, you can choose to delete the unwanted pages or wipe out the whole wiki.
