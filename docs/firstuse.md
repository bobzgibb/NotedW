# First use

## "Installation"
These days the corporate IT security departments are getting more and more creative in stripping every possible rights from the poor users. There are many good note taking softwares and applications, but one cannot use it in the workplace. There are also many web-based note taking tools - but they are hosting the information in the cloud, i.e. outside the company. Such breach could easily lead to HR consequences. Better stay on the local computer. 

The NotedW is a SPA, which means that just a single HTML file is needed. Copy the file to a sympathetic folder or onto your desktop et voil√°, the NotedW is installed on your computer. 

To fire up, just open a browser. Theoretically it works in all major browsers - but only Chrome is tested. Open the file in your browser, and you will find an empty notebook, like this:
