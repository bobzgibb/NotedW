# NotedW usage information 

## Cave at and always keep in mind
The NotedW is not backing up / archiving your work, you have to take care of your information. The created notes are stored in the browser's LocalStorage - read more on that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). When purging all history / cache / cookies / etc. from your browser you can easily loose the content of your NotedW as well. It is highly advised to use the [backup](backup.md) functionality of NotedW regularly. 

A personal remark - I have not lost any content ever. Still, it is better to be prepared. 

## Other limitations
### Storage space 
The NotedW is intended for local use as a single page web-app. Because of this, the limit of the LocalStorage is a hard limit, you cannot circumvent it to win additional space by splitting the notes (eg. on dividing work / private). 

### NotedW in online environment 
An online version of NotedW is not (yet) planned. The app is not tested in online environment, the security risks are unknown. So if you plan to use it online by publishing under a URL - do it at your own risk, you have been warned.
