# NotedW
Wiki-like personal knowledge management tool running locally in browser

# Install & first use
- Just copy the single ```dist/wiki.html``` file to any local folder, and open it in your favourite browser. 
- It is advised to add a new page with the title ```Main```. This will serve as a "homepage" in the future. 

# General instructions on use
- You can use the markdown syntax on the pages
- You can refer to pages by their names within ```[]```
- If you refer to a non-existing page, you can create it, by clicking on the link
- You can use simple diagrams by following the mermaid syntax within a code block


# Credits

Many thanks to the
- [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) project for the Markdown parser,
- [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) project for the graph library,
- and to the StackExchange community for the hundreds of already asked and answered questions, which helped me along.
(No new question was posted, and no living animals were harmed during
development.)
