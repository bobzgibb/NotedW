Many thanks to the
- [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) project for the Markdown parser,
- [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) project for the graph library,
- and to the StackExchange community for the hundreds of already asked and answered questions, which helped me along.
(No new question was posted, and no living animals were harmed during
development.)

This personal wiki is created by Bob Gibb. You can contact me if you have
questions, suggestions, etc.
